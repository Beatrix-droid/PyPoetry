    This is a small python package that takes a word imputted from a user and scrapes data from a
    rhyming dictionary to create a list of words that rhyme with the one imputted by the user.

    the function find_rhyme takes two parameters, the word
    the user would like to find rhyming words for and an optional parameter,
    the syllable parameter. With the syllable parameter the user can input an integer that specifies how many
    syllables they woud like the rhyming word to have, and the find_rhyme function will then scrape only the rhyming
    words that have that number of syllables.

    If the syllable parameter is not specified the function
    will return a list of all the words that rhyme with it """

    This package will soon be available on the pip package manager, so to install
    simply write in the terminal/command prompt:
    "pip install Pypoetry"
